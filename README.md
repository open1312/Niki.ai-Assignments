# Niki.ai Assignments


This is the Python Assignment which for Niki.ai. Below are the questions for the assignment.

1. Write a function that accepts a list of strings from stdin, and sorts it based on length of those strings. The output is the sorted list of strings.

2. Assuming the following cipher: 1=A, 2=B, 3=C,...,26=Z,27=AA, 28=AB, ??? write a python function which takes two integers m and n (1 < m < n < 676) and prints the character equivalents of each in a new line. For eg. if the input was m=25 and n=29, it will output:
  >Y
  >Z
  >AA
  >AB
  >AC
  
3. Write a factorisation function which accepts an integer (less than 100000) and prints all its factors greater than 1. It should also print whether a number is prime; if so.


To finally code the above program I have used Python 3.5 versions (As I didn't have python 2.7 installed in any of my machines).

Please feel free to reach out to me if you have any further questions.
